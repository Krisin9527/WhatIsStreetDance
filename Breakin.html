                            Breaking, also called breaking or b-boying/b-girling, is an athletic style of street dance originating from the African American and Puerto Rican communities in the United States. While diverse in the amount of variation available in the dance, breakdancing
                            mainly consists of four kinds of movement: toprock, downrock, power moves and freezes. Breakdancing is typically set to songs containing drum breaks, especially in hip-hop, funk, soul music and breakbeat music, although modern
                            trends allow for much wider varieties of music along certain ranges of tempo and beat patterns. Breakdancing was created by Trixie (Lauree Myers), RIP Wallace D, Dancing Doug (Douglas Colon), A1 Bboy Sasa, DJ Clark Kent (Tyrone
                            Smith), The Legendary Smith Twins, The Zulu Kings and Cholly Rock (Anthony G. Horne), OG BGirl - Darlene Rivers, "Puppet" (William "Billy Bill" Waring), Darryl Solomon (The Mad Hatter), Kurtis Blow, Troy Harewood, Lil Cesar
                            Rivas, Shabba-Doo, and Puerto Rican youth in the early 1970s.[1][self-published source?] By the late 1970s, the dance had begun to spread to other communities and was gaining wider popularity;[2] at the same time, the dance
                            had peaked in popularity among African Americans and Puerto Ricans.[2] A practitioner of this dance is called a b-boy, b-girl, breakdancer or breaker. Although the term "breakdance" is frequently used to refer to the dance
                            in popular culture and in the mainstream entertainment industry, "b-boying" and "breaking" were the original terms and are preferred by the majority of the pioneers and most notable practitioners.[3][4]
